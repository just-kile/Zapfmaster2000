## Install for frontend build processing
This package installs karma test runner and its dependencies globally (because maven-karma-plugin expect this :-/ )

Step 1.: Install nodejs and npm 
Type in command 

* `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js`
* `sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`

It is recommended to install karma and gulp globally


That's it!
